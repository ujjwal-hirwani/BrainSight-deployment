# 🚀 BrainSight – Revolutionizing Brain Tumor Detection

🧠 *See deeper. Diagnose smarter.*

## 💡 Project Overview

**BrainSight** is an AI-powered web application designed to detect brain tumors from MRI scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**, the tool demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare, aiming to assist in early diagnosis and awareness.

## 🔍 Features

* 🔄 **Real-Time Prediction**: Upload MRI scans and get instant results.
* 🧠 **Tumor Classification**: Detects 3 types of brain tumors:

  * Glioma
  * Meningioma
  * Pituitary
  * Or identifies as **No Tumor**
* 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple UI built for accessibility and ease of use.
* ⚙️ **Built with**:

  * Flask (backend)
  * HTML/CSS/JS (frontend)
  * CNN model trained on labeled MRI data

## 🧪 Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Frameworks/Libraries**: Flask, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Model Type**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
* **Deployment**: Render (free-tier)

## 🌍 Use Case

> *BrainSight* is intended for **educational and assistive** purposes. While not a substitute for clinical tools, it can support:

* Medical students in learning diagnostics
* Researchers in preliminary screening
* Awareness campaigns showcasing AI in healthcare

## 🎯 Motivation

The idea stemmed from a desire to apply deep learning to a socially impactful domain. With the growing burden of brain tumors globally, AI-based tools like BrainSight can play a supportive role in diagnosis and understanding.
